CURRENT VERSION: 6.18.19.3

INFO:
Version format is month.day.year.branch + revision number. 6.18.19.0104 means that the version is from June 18th, 2019, from the alpha
branch and has been updated a total of 4 times (xx.xx.xx.0104)
Alpha branch is when major changes are made, or things are added top the project. With alpha, things will get some very basic testing to
ensure that these changes (in their current form) appear in game.
Beta branch is for testing Alpha branch releases for reliability. This includes having the changes appear through multiple loads, dropping
in multiple instances of the same planet, and checking for any sort of inconsistancy or issues that interfere with gameplay mechanics.
Master branch contains the most stable, and well tested version that is availible. Master branches are ready for general release once the
appropriate milestones are made.
MILESTONES:
In each branch, different milestones are assigned, which represent a point where significant changes which have been predetermined have
been reached. Once a milestone is reached, the branch is merged with the next branch, where it can run through the the milestones of that
branch.
ALL BRANCHES, SANS MASTER BRANCH WILL HAVE MILESTONES ASSIGNED THAT MUST BE REACHED BEFORE MOVING ON.
