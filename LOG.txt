INFO:
Version format is year.month.day.branch + revision number
Branch number:
01: Master
02: Beta
03: Alpha

19.06.18.0104 means that the version is from June 18th, 2019, from the master branch and has been updated a total of 4 times (xx.xx.xx.0104)
-Alpha branch represents the latest nightly builds. Alpha has assigned milestones to it, where the goal is to reach the assigned milestones in the order they are assigned. Additional milestones are added as needed to ensure that the project remains flexible as new complications can be addressed.
-Beta branch represents builds where alpha branch milestones have been reached, but the build remains largely untested. Beta builds are basically test
candidates. Like the Alpha branch, beta has milestones. However, these milestones represent a set list of testing mechanics which are repeatedly run over every single update.
-Master branch represents stable builds which have reached major milestones and have been tested throughly. Master branch is the branch which is uploaded to the Steam Workshop.
ALL BRANCHES, SANS MASTER, WILL HAVE MILESTONES ASSIGNED THAT MUST BE REACHED BEFORE MOVING ON.

19.6.18.0303
	ADDED: Created log (you're reading it)
	ADDED: Uploaded original copies of the planets to github
	ADDED: Alpha branch. This branch will contain the initial updates for compatability with the newer planetary additions, and all
	       new modifications and additions to the planets, with very light testing.
	ADDED: Beta branch. Beta branch is where changes will be tweaked and additional testing will be done to ensure that the end product is
	       stable.
	ADDED: Release Branch. This is what is currently released to the workshop. Will be blank until new versions are up past the initial
	       release.
	ADDED: Set up initial milestones for alpha, beta, and release branch.
	FIXED: Version was wrong on the log document.
	FIXED: Cleaned up the look of the log so its easier to read.
	ADDED: Updated Aibos to new standards and features.
	TODO: Update Aibos to have it's landscape look proper. Adjust lighting so that the day sky is completely non-existant.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	CHANGED: Aibos surface detail values tweaked to give the planet a better overall look, and to help with performance (kept running out of             	VRAM).

	TODO: Redo textures so planets looks proper.


19.10.30.0306
	ADDED: GhostXiV Cloud layers. Version in Alpha is the updated one made to fit the current file structure.


19.12.08.0307
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	FIXED: Updated versioning, as previous versioning of having the month.date.year.branch + revision number would result in the version decreasing come 	       January of next year. Also, having alpha being 01 with the master version being 03 gave the impression that alpha builds were potentially 	 	       behind master builds, should both be updated on the same day. This fixes such inconsistancies.
